STR,Leap,Ability,Action,-,-,-,-,4,5,6,7,8,Movement,,,"Unlike most movement, Leap is an Action. 
When the Hero leaps, he declares his destination, and how many rounds he will spend in the air. This decision is limited by his Distance and Hangtime attributes.
Distance determines how far the Hero can move per round
Hangtime determines the max amount of time a Hero can spend in the air. 
Once a Leap is declared, the Hero may not change his target or decide to land early. 
A Leap may ignore obstacles whose height is less than or equal to the Distance attribute.
The Hero may perform Actions and Moves as normal on subsequent turns, though he may not perform grounded actions. If he becomes grounded, the Leap ends immediately.
All melee attacks made upon landing count as a single-hex AoE.
This attack receives a damage buff: 
1d4 (c) per round spent in the air.
Partial Effect: Targets avoid 50% DMG
The Hero maintains his Leap even if damaged; however, the Hero remains susceptible to Knock back.
